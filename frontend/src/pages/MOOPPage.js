      <h1>Multi Objective Optimization Problems (MOOP)</h1>
      <p>
        Multi Objective Optimization Problems involve optimizing multiple conflicting objectives simultaneously.
        Unlike SOOP, where there's only one objective, MOOP requires finding a balance or trade-off between
        different objectives, often leading to a set of optimal solutions known as the Pareto front.
      </p>
      <p>
        MOOPs are commonly used in scenarios where decisions must consider various factors, such as cost, quality,
        and time. Explore the complexities, methodologies, and examples provided to understand how to approach MOOP.
