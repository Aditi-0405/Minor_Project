        <h2 className={styles.sectionTitle}>What is Optimization?</h2>
        <p className={styles.optimizationDescription}>
          Optimization is the process of making something as effective or functional as possible. It involves selecting the best option from a set of alternatives, taking into account constraints and objectives. In mathematics, optimization involves finding the maximum or minimum value of a function under given conditions.
