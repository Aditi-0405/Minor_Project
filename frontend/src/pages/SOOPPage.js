      <h1>Single Objective Optimization Problems (SOOP)</h1>
      <p>
        Single Objective Optimization Problems involve optimizing a single criterion or objective function.
        The goal is to find the best possible solution that either maximizes or minimizes the objective function
        within a defined set of constraints.

        Common examples include minimizing cost or maximizing efficiency in engineering problems. Explore
        the concepts, methodologies, and examples provided to gain a deeper understanding of SOOP.
